//! Backend-agnostic authentication conversation.
//!
//! Authentication on Unix is a *conversation*: the backend (PAM, or a greetd
//! daemon) asks one or more questions — password, OTP, "your password expired,
//! enter a new one" — and the UI answers each in turn. This crate models that
//! exchange so the same UI can drive either backend.
//!
//! A backend implements [`AuthConversation`] and drives the whole exchange on a
//! dedicated blocking thread, calling the supplied `ask` closure whenever it
//! needs input from the user. [`spawn`] wires `ask` to the GTK loop: each
//! prompt is marshalled out via an `on_event` callback, and the UI sends its
//! reply back through the returned [`AuthHandle`].
//!
//! The crate is deliberately free of any GUI dependency — it only speaks in
//! [`AuthPrompt`]/[`AuthEvent`] values and channels, so it can be reused by the
//! lock screen (inside a running session, [`PamAuth`]) and, later, by a
//! pre-login greeter talking to greetd.
