//! Bringing tunnels back after a suspend.
//!
//! NetworkManager tears a VPN down when the machine sleeps — unless its
//! profile is persistent, as the openconnect profiles wayle makes are, and then
//! the tunnel rides the suspend out on its own — and brings none of them back
//! on wake: a VPN is never autoconnected on its own. So the tunnels that were up
//! on the way down are recorded, and re-activated once the network they ride
//! on is back, through [`Vpn::restore`]: the secret agent hands NM whatever it
//! has cached, and a session that needs signing into again is left for the
//! next connect, since nobody is there to approve a second factor at wake.
//!
//! A restart of NetworkManager — a package upgrade — is the same story: it
//! takes the tunnels down on its way out and brings none of them back. So
//! the tunnels NM was running when it went away are brought back once it
//! returns, by the same path. An openconnect tunnel seldom makes it: its
//! plugin logs the session off as NM goes, and that is left for a connect.
//!
//! Only tunnels that were up are restored. One the user had turned off stays
//! off, and nothing is recorded across a reboot: the record lives in memory,
//! so this can never become a VPN that dials itself unattended.
