//! VPN state and control, with NetworkManager as the single source of truth.
//!
//! Every VPN is an NM connection profile — a plugin VPN (OpenVPN,
//! OpenConnect and its whole protocol family, IPsec, L2TP, PPTP, SSTP, …) or a
//! native WireGuard profile, which needs no plugin at all because the kernel
//! carries it. Nothing is declared in wayle's config: the list is whatever NM
//! holds, so a VPN added from the widget shows up with no restart and no TOML.
//!
//! Two watchers drive the whole thing, and neither polls:
//!
//! - the profile list rides [`Settings::connections`], which NM's
//!   `NewConnection` / `ConnectionRemoved` signals already keep current;
//! - state rides NM's active-connection list, plus one `StateChanged`
//!   subscription per *currently active* VPN, because a tunnel going from
//!   `activating` to `activated` never changes the list it is in.
//!
//! Tunnels that were up when the machine slept are brought back on wake; see
//! [`resume`].
//!
//! Credentials — passwords, 2FA challenges, session cookies — are not handled
//! here. NM asks a registered secret agent for those; see [`crate::agent`].
