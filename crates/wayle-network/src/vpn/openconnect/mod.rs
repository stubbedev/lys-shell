//! Producing the openconnect plugin's secrets without an openconnect binary.
//!
//! NetworkManager's openconnect plugin does not ask for a password. It asks
//! for a `cookie`, a `gateway` and a `gwcert` — the *output* of an
//! authentication, not its input. Conventionally an agent gets those by
//! spawning the plugin's own `nm-openconnect-auth-dialog`, which drives
//! libopenconnect through the whole sign-in.
//!
//! wayle authenticates itself instead. For GlobalProtect that is a form POST
//! and, when the gateway asks, a second one carrying the 2FA answer; for
//! AnyConnect it is an XML exchange in which the gateway describes the form it
//! wants filled in. Either way it is plain HTTPS with no tunnel involved,
//! which is exactly what `openconnect --authenticate` does before handing the
//! cookie to something else. The resulting cookie is cached, so a reconnect
//! costs no second factor.
//!
//! The tunnel itself is still NetworkManager's plugin. This module replaces
//! the sign-in, the helper script and the systemd unit around it — not the
//! thing that moves packets.
