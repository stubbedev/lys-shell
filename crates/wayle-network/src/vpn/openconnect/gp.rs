//! GlobalProtect gateway authentication, spoken natively over HTTPS.
//!
//! Authenticating to a GlobalProtect gateway is a form POST that answers with
//! either a challenge (2FA) or a session cookie. None of it needs a VPN
//! client: the `openconnect` binary's `--authenticate` mode does exactly this
//! and then prints the cookie for someone else to use. wayle does the same
//! thing in-process and hands the result to NetworkManager's openconnect
//! plugin, which is what actually carries the packets.
//!
//! The wire details — endpoint, body fields, and above all the *positional*
//! meaning of the `<argument>` elements in the reply — are openconnect's
//! `auth-globalprotect.c`. They are pinned by the tests below, because a
//! silent shift in that list would hand the gateway's cookie slot to something
//! else and fail in a way no error message would explain.
